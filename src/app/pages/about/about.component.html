    <h2>Our Story</h2>
  
    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>
      This school was started on 16th July 1956 as a result of the need felt by the education committee of the catholic diocese of Tuticorin. This was actually a high school when it was started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially it was a co-ed school. As the number of girls increased, it was decided to start a separate high school for their welfare. The servite sisters came forward to run the girls' school and thus in 1964 Stella Mary's high school was started and Holy Redeemer's became solely boys' school.
    </p>
    <p>
      n 1977, the school was upgraded to higher secondary level, both boys and girls were admitted in higher secondary sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim of this school is to sharpen the young minds and instil in them a sense of 
      patriotism based on scientific atitude. Education is imparted here with a feeling of oneness. 
      Students are highly motivated to get mingled among themselves irrespective of religion and caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year, it is heartening to see a good number of our students going for professional courses 
      like medicine, engineering, agriculture, and law etc., . This school is determined to 
      give the best education to the poor students of this vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school is also fully involved in letting the students unearth and develop their given to help them grow in areas like drawing, music, talents. Special attention ingrain in the minds of students various dance and drama. Due care is given values of life so that they remain God fearing, and morally sound.

    <h2>Our Motto</h2>
    <h5>"Striving for Excellence, Rooted in Faith"</h5>
    <p>
      The motto of our school is "life of knowledge and service". 
      True knowledge is supposed to spread its wings keeping God in the centre. 
      All forms of arts and science are well placed in their wide-spread circle of knowledge. 
      Knowledge that creates clear vision, independent of blind faith is what needed to our students. 
      Still this knowledge alone can by no means lead them to an entirety of life. 
      Only the Knowledge that is shared for the good of others can be a real knowledge. 
      Thus our students can lead a meaningful life and this is what we mean by "Life of service". 
      The students are educated with this aim in the school.

      <p>
        The flag and the emblem of the school are designed in such a way to expose the above 
        mentioned motto. The flag consists of yellow and red colours where yellow indicates 
        knowledge and the red indicates sacrifice. On the surface of the yellow colour. 
        A cross and a lamp are found. They remind us of the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross and 
        the unflinching attitude of lamp in dispelling darkness whereas on the surface of the 
        red colour we find a spade and a loom. They, in turn remind us recall the ever appreciable 
        service of the farmers and the committed life of Gandhi, the father of our nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this juncture, we pray God, the alpha and omega of all knowledge to shower 
        his grace and make our students both knowledgeable and serviceable and take the nation 
        to the level unreached.
